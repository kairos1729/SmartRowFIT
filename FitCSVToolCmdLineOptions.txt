      -ex Changes the behaviour of the --defn and --data options to
          filter out the messages listed. The default behaviour without
          this flag is to exclude all messages except those listed
          after the --defn and the --data options.
      -pN Encode file using Protocol Version <N>. Default: 1
      -e Print enum values as their corresponding String labels when
          possible. Note: CSV files generated with this option will not
          be able to be converted back into .FIT files.
      -re Remove expanded fields from CSV output. This removes fields
          that have been generated through component expansion and
          which do not exist in the source .FIT file
      --defn <MESSAGE_STRING_0,MESSAGE_STRING_1,...> Narrows down the
          definitions output to CSV. Use 'none' for no definitions
          When this option is used only the message definitions
          in the comma separated list will be written to the CSV.
          eg. --defn file_capabilities,record,file_creator
          Note: This option is only compatible with the -b option.
      --data <MESSAGE_STRING_0,MESSAGE_STRING_1,...> Narrows down the
          data output to CSV. When this option is used only the data
          in the comma separated list will be written to the csv.
          eg. --data file_capabilities,record,file_creator
          Note: This option is only compatible with the -b option.
